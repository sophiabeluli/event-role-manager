# Discord Event Role Manager [WIP]

A role manager bot for discord that deals exclusively with managing roles for events.

-   Creates role for event on event creation, and deletes the role when the event is canceled/finished.
-   Assigns role to users who tick interested, and unassigns role when they untick.
-   Roles have the same name as the event for easy searching/pinging.

---

## Future Features

-   Displaying info for recently finished events (slash command)
